# quizlet-speak
Chrome extension that uses Web Browser Speech Synthesis to speak the quiz word accented with the correct language

## Why?

Quizlet offers spoken language support for many languages, but not all.  This extension allows users to hear spoken words from any language supported by their OS.

## Where?

This extension has only been tested on Chrome 68 on MacOS High Sierra, but should work on Chrome on other platforms.
